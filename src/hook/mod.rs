//! Systems to insert components on loaded scenes.
//!
//! Hooks allow you to run code on a scene after loading it. It provides an API
//! similar to the bevy [`Scene`], but with the ability to add components
//! to scene entities once they are loaded.
//!
//! This crate has two hook types:
//! 1. The very basic [`SceneHook`], it has a `hook` function field. It will
//!    run once per entity within the scene, with the ability to add new
//!    components to the entity and read its existing components.
//! 2. The more advanced [`reload::Hook`]. Which works like [`SceneHook`],
//!    but is aware of **reload** state, and also has access to the ECS `&World`
//!    and the root `Entity` of the scene it is running for.
//!
//! The respective documentation of [`SceneHook`] and [`reload::Hook`] for
//! usage examples.
